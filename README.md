# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection from MRI using CNN & GPU Acceleration

A deep learning project that detects **brain tumors** (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor) using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on MRI images. Built with TensorFlow and accelerated with GPU support, this project also includes a **Gradio web interface** for live predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Classifies brain MRIs into **4 categories**: `glioma`, `meningioma`, `notumor`, `pituitary`
- ⚡ Powered by **TensorFlow GPU** for faster training and inference
- 🧠 Built using **CNN** with high accuracy
- 🌐 Live testing using an elegant **Gradio Interface**
- 📊 Includes analytics: confidence scores and visualizations
- 🔍 Easily extendable to other medical imaging datasets
